    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepoc has traditionally been designed as a reinforced masonry element in bending. Early compression testing of Stepoc provided results for the characteristic compressive strength of the masonry ($f_k$) of circa 18 MPa. Therefore over decades Stepoc has been designed using this figure when deriving the maximum moment capacity of the section and the lever arm ($z$) when determining reinforcement quantities below this maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2020 Lucideon undertook compressive strength testing under instruction from Anderton Concrete. The report published is referenced (196661) (QT-57177/1/JB)/Ref. 1. From this report a number of salient points are to be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 256 Stepoc $f_k$ = 9.92 MPa\n",
    "- 325 Stepoc $f_k$ = 9.37 MPa\n",
    "- Failure was deemed to be at the limit of the machine\n",
    "\n",
    "In testing Stepoc with such procedures it is difficult to get truly meaningful results due to the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stress distribution between the concrete core and the masonry shell is dependent on the stiffness of each\n",
    "- The stress distribution between the core and the shell is dependent upon the clean and even application of load\n",
    "- Due to the size of the section and the high strength of concrete the capacity of the machine is easily reached (2000kN)\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly test to failure it is possible that the applied force over a meter of wall would need to be in excess of 6000kN. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the design of Stepoc it has been traditionally assumed that the section of the wall within the compressive stress block is of a uniform material. This is a simplistic assumption but one that functioned well when the reported $f_k$ was in the region of 18MPa. However, BS EN 1996-1-1 places a limited on the moment capacity of the section with the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align} \n",
    "M_{Rd} \\leq 0.40 f_d b d^2\\label{cap1}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "It can therefore be seen that a reduction in the published $f_k$ for Stepoc results in an artificial (based on historic performance of structures constructed from Stepoc) limit on the bending capacity of the section. By way of example for 256mm Stepoc using equation \\ref{cap1}"
